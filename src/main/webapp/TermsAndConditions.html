    	<p>Welcome to Muvflix! We are a subscription service that provides our members with access to movies and other content streamed over the Internet to certain Internet-connected TVs, computers and other devices ("Media Devices"). Our service also provides recommendations, reviews and other information regarding these movies and TV shows (the “Service”).</p>
   		<p>This website (the “Website”) is made available to you by (Naspek International SA). Your access to and use of this Site is strictly subject to these Terms and Conditions of Use. By accessing this Site, the user ("YOU") agrees to be unconditionally bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Membership. </b> Your membership will continue month-to-month until terminated. Unless you cancel your membership before your monthly renewal date, you authorize us to charge your next month's membership fee to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below). To use the service you must have Internet access and a Ready device, and you must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment, which you may update from time to time ("Payment Method"). You can find specific details regarding your membership with us by visiting our website and clicking on the "Your Account" link available at the bottom of the pages of the Website.</li>
			<li><b>Free Trials</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Your membership may start with a free trial. The free trial period of your membership lasts for 5 days, or as otherwise specified during sign-up and is intended to allow new members and certain former members to try the service. You will be notified during sign-up whether you are eligible for a free trial.</li>
					<li>We will bill your Payment Method for your monthly membership fee at the end of the free trial period unless you cancel your membership prior to the end of the free trial period. </li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><b>Billing</b>
				<ol>
					<li><u>Billing Cycle.</u> The membership fee for our service will be billed on a monthly basis to your Payment Method on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paid membership. In some cases the timing of your billing may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled or if your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month.</li>
					<li><u>Payment Methods.</u>    If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not change your Payment Method or cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the Service until we have obtained a valid Payment Method. You authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.</li>
					<li><u>Cancellation.</u>You can cancel your membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Service through the end of your monthly billing period. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial-month membership periods or unwatched movies or TV shows. To cancel, go to the "Support" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. If you signed up for the Website using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your membership at any time, including during your free trial, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from, the Service through that third party. You may also find billing information about your membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.</li>
					<li><u>Changes to the Terms of Use.</u> Naspek International SA reserves the right, from time to time, with or without notice to you, to change these Terms of Use in our sole and absolute discretion. The most current version of these Terms of Use can be reviewed by visiting our website and clicking on "Terms" located at the bottom of the pages of the website. The most current version of the Terms of Use will supersede all previous versions.</li>
				</ol>

					<li>The service and any content viewed through the service are for your personal and non-commercial use only. During your membership we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to access the Service and view movies and TV shows on a streaming-only basis. Except for the foregoing limited license, no right, title or interest shall be transferred to you. You agree not to use the Service for public performances.</li>
					<li>You may view a movie or TV show through the Service primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such movie or TV show. The content that may be available to watch will vary by geographic location and will change from time to time. The number of devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on your chosen subscription plan and is specified on the "Your Account" page.</li>
					<li>We continually update the Service, including the content library. In addition, we continually test various aspects of our service, including our website, user interfaces, promotional features and availability of movies and TV shows. You can at any time opt-out of these tests by visiting the "Your Account" page and changing the "Test participation" settings.</li>
					<li>You agree to use the Service, including all features and functionalities associated therewith, in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, or other restrictions on use of the service or content therein. You agree not to archive, download, reproduce, distribute, modify, display, perform, publish, license, create derivative works from, offer for sale, or use (except as explicitly authorized in these Terms of Use) content and information contained on or obtained from or through the Service. You also agree not to: circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade or thwart any of the content protections in the service; use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Service; decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any software or other products or processes accessible through the Service; insert any code or product or manipulate the content of the Service in any way; or, use any data mining, data gathering or extraction method.

					<li>The quality of the display of the streaming movies and TV shows may vary from computer to computer, and device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection. The minimum connection speed for SD quality is 0.5 Mbps; however, we recommend a faster connection for improved video quality. HD and Ultra HD availability is subject to your Internet service and device capabilities. Not all content is available in HD or Ultra HD and not all subscription plans allow you to receive HD or Ultra HD content. A download speed of at least 5.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to receive HD content, which is defined as 720p or better.

Please check with your Internet provider for information on possible Internet data usage charges. The time it takes to begin watching a movie or TV show will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time, the movie or TV show you have selected and the configuration of your Media Device.</li>

You are responsible for updating and maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide to us relating to your account.
